Referencing Plugin README
=========================

--- 

This repository is for my vim referencing plugin project. I want to create a plugin for writing references and bibliographies in vim.

---

In an effort to find a way to write my Academic papers, and my PhD thesis purely inside of vim, I want to create a way of painlessly creating a list of references in vim, in markdown or Rmarkdown documents.

Let me know if you're interested to join in.
